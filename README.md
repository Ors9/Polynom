# Polynomial Operations and Representation

A Java project for representing and manipulating polynomials using OOP principles.

## ðŸ“š Description

This project implements polynomial arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, derivative, and equality check. Each polynomial is represented using a list of terms, where each term includes a coefficient and an exponent.

The polynomials are parsed from user input and stored using an `ArrayList` of terms, sorted by exponent in descending order. The system supports:

- Addition of two polynomials (`plus`)
- Subtraction of two polynomials (`minus`)
- Derivative of a polynomial (`derivative`)
- String representation in standard mathematical format (`toString`)
- Equality check between polynomials (`equals`)


## Note
You can download the zip file and export it and that click twice on run.bat and the program will run on your computer
